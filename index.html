<h2>Asteroid Run</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fly your spaceship through the dangerous smugglers route that goes straight through an asteroid belt full of pirates and mines, where every asteroid and laser blast can damage your ship’s systems in various ways requiring you to fix your ship between stages.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
the player should feel challenged.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Arcade shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players fly through levels of an asteroid field blasting asteroids or enemy ships along the way. The first several levels are mostly asteroids, but progressively add new obstacles like: mines, various enemy space ships, or just much larger asteroids. Asteroids, when blasted, break apart into smaller asteroids which may do less damage but create more obstacles unless broken into harmlessly small fragments. The larger the asteroid and the faster it’s moving the more damage it will do to the player’s health (hull), but also may damage a component of the ship. Damaged components add some negative effect to the player’s ship, such as: weaker lasers, no lasers, slower turning, slower speed, or other tweaks to the player’s controls and stats. They may also apply more interesting effects like: reversed controls (up is down), constant full speed, fuel leakage, unstable lasers that explode if fired, stalling engines, excessive noise (drawing in enemy ships), etc. The player is given one opportunity to remove (repair) one of these negative effects after each level - one of the options will always be some percentage of hull repair. Upon finishing a run through the asteroid field, the player is rewarded with money to spend on more quality ships (less likely to break and/or different stats) as well as have their notoriety increased which increases the likelihood of pirates, cops, and other enemy ships spawning. The goal is to make as much money as possible, and all of the money is lost if the player dies during one of their runs through the asteroid field.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Evaluate the entertainment of having the ship break as damage and repairing between levels. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Breaking components - player stats, controls, and effects may be changed when damage is taken.
Endless Game - high score that can increase as long as the player keeps playing and stays alive while also increasing the difficulty of subsequent runs.

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this world, pirates sail through space like the open sea, cops are symbols of oppression, and smuggling is the most daring and impressive job out there. Flying through dangerous asteroid belts that cops have more difficulty policing is exhilarating and is a proving ground for star ship pilots.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In this future, man has colonies far and wide, and illegal trade has become a lucrative business, but the authorities have gotten better at policing the vast space between these colonies. Smugglers are forced to go to dangerous lengths to make sure their cargo reaches its destination and they put their lives on the line to avoid being caught. You are one of the daring smugglers that refused to retire and you seek to prove yourself as one of the best pilots there is, and get wealthy along the way.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A game for fans of space ship SHMUPS or classic asteroids between 12 and 40 that want a little more from there shooters than reflex and dexterity tests.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1 minutes to 1 hour.
Prototype: about 1 - 3 minutes 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Blasting paths through smaller rocks. Flying faster to achieve better time and gain more currency for better payout. Slowing to fire at mines. Speeding through clusters of asteroids to wreck enemy ships that are following from behind. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All graphics are by Eric Miller using GIMP.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Asteroids, FTL.
